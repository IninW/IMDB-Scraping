# IMDB-Scraping

Some R code I wrote in a project to scrape the release date of movies from IMDB website, also to further scrape gross and budget data from IMDB as some of them are missing in our original dataset. 

Scrape release data: 
codes: R scrap - imdb movies
dataset: movie.csv

Scrape gross and budget data: 
codes: R scrap - business
dataset: gross_movie3
